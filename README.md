# Discrete-Mathematics-for-Java-Programmers

Here is the material for my course at IMT Atlantique about Discrete Mathematics for Java programmers.

FIL software engineering apprenticeship program (http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/formation/ingenieur-par-apprentissage/ingenieurs-specialite-ingenierie-logicielle). This 3-year program leads to a Master's degree in software engineering at IMT Atlantique.

About 30 students each year.

Half a day block = I program in front of the students for 75 minutes, then the students get my code and complete it for 150 minutes.
There are 4 blocks. 
I evaluate the last (4th) block.
Total time = 15h.

- bloc 1: quantified boolean expression evaluation
- bloc 2: boolean expression proof
- bloc 3: proof by induction for natural expressions
- bloc 4: evaluation

The code is presented in two different versions:

1. in Md: (`.md`) literate markdown 
  https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.3/tools/literate-programming.html#literate-markdown
  It renders nicely on github. It is the one you wish to browse online.

2. in TPi: (`.java`) plain Java.
   It can be used to focus on code.
